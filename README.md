# shadowfax
As a writer, the problem I’ve found with many WordPress themes is that they’re too overpowering – they showcase media and images and are designed for larger or more commercial sites.

I prefer a quieter layout that’s easy to read on any device. It can still incorporate images, video, sharing buttons, social media links, and the like, but the words on a writer’s blog should be front and center. 

My solution is the shadowfax Jekyll theme, which is loosely based on Tinos for WordPress and its elegant multi-column and responsive layout. (GNU license: https://www.cssigniter.com/license/)
