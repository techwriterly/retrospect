# retrospect
Most WordPress themes tend to be designed for larger or more commercial sites and showcase visual media instead of writing. As a writer, I prefer a quieter layout thatâ€™s easy to read on any device. It can still incorporate images, video, sharing buttons, social media links, and the like, but the words should be front and center. My solution was to create the "retrospect" Jekyll theme, which is currently under construction.
