# shadowfax
As a writer, the problem I’ve found with most WordPress themes is that they tend to be designed for larger or more commercial sites and showcase visual media instead of writing.

I prefer a quieter layout that’s easy to read on any device. It can still incorporate images, video, sharing buttons, social media links, and the like, but the words should be front and center. My solution was to create the shadowfax Jekyll theme, which is loosely based on Tinos for WordPress and its elegant multi-column and responsive layout.
